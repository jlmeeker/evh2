# In order to have Apache reverse proxy to your go app, try this in your VirtualHost definition:
#   This one uses /new/ as a subpath to an existing site.
#   Be sure to set the following in the config (to work with this example): 
#     listenaddr=127.0.0.1
#     urlprefix=<empty>
#     ssl=false
#     nonsslport=8080
    RewriteEngine on
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/
